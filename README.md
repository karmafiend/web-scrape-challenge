# What the project does: 
Enables review of and scraping of Mars news content from the 'https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html' website.

# How users can get started with the project: 
Download, run analysis and evaluate results for self. Code allows for summary scraping of the Mars News website and the export of Martian conditions for analysis and review by users. 

# Resources used for building SQL project include:
Multiple sources such as: I referenced official Bootcamp course material and documentation; instructor teaching (classes & shared resources), aid from fellow students, Google Search, StackOverflow, W3C Schools, content as well as support and guidance from the Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT.
